## Fundamentals

### Texas Hold'em Basics
- **Goal:** Win chips by having the best 5-card hand OR making opponents fold
- **Betting Rounds:** Pre-flop → Flop (3 cards) → Turn (1 card) → River (1 card)
- **Positions:** Button (dealer) → Small Blind → Big Blind → Early Position → Middle Position → Late Position

### The Golden Rules
1. **Position > Cards** - Where you act matters more than what you hold
2. **Aggression Wins** - Betting/raising gives you two ways to win (fold or best hand)
3. **Range Thinking** - Think in terms of hand ranges, not specific hands
4. **Pot Control** - Sometimes keeping the pot small is optimal
5. **Adapt to Opponents** - GTO is baseline, exploit weaknesses when possible

## Position is EVERYTHING

### Position Rankings (Power Level)
1. **Button (BTN)** - Acts last all streets, MOST profitable
2. **Cut-Off (CO)** - Acts last pre-flop (except BTN), very profitable
3. **Hijack (HJ)** - Middle-late position, start opening range
4. **Middle Position (MP)** - Neutral, tighten up
5. **Early Position (EP/UTG)** - Acts first, TIGHTEST range
6. **Blinds (SB/BB)** - Forced money, awkward position, LEAST profitable

### Why Position Matters
- **Information Advantage:** See opponents act before you
- **Pot Control:** Can check back to control pot size
- **Bluffing Power:** Can rep wider ranges when checked to
- **Stealing Blinds:** Late position can steal with wider range
- **Post-Flop Edge:** Position = more profitable spots

### Position-Based Opening Ranges

**UTG (Under the Gun - ~15% of hands):**
- Premium: AA-TT, AK, AQ
- Strong: AJs+, KQs
- Action: Raise 2.5-3bb

**MP (Middle Position - ~20% of hands):**
- Add: 99-77, ATs, KJs, QJs, JTs
- Action: Raise 2.5-3bb

**CO (Cut-Off - ~30% of hands):**
- Add: 66-22, A9s-A2s, K9s+, suited connectors, Broadway
- Action: Raise 2.5bb

**BTN (Button - ~50% of hands):**
- Add: Any suited connector, any suited ace, most Broadway, pairs
- Action: Raise 2-2.5bb (wider range vs weak blinds)

**SB (Small Blind - ~35% of hands when folded to):**
- Tighter than BTN, wider than earlier positions
- Action: Raise 3bb or limp (advanced)

**BB (Big Blind - Defend ~40-50%):**
- Already invested 1bb, defend vs steals
- Call with speculative hands, 3-bet with premium

---

## Pre-Flop Strategy

### Opening Raise Sizing
- **Cash Games:** 2.5-3bb from EP/MP, 2-2.5bb from CO/BTN
- **Tournaments:** 2-2.5bb standard (preserve chips)
- **Live Games:** 3-5bb (softer competition, isolation)

### 3-Betting (Re-Raising)
**When to 3-Bet:**
1. **Value:** AA-QQ, AK (sometimes JJ, AQ)
2. **Bluff:** Polarized range with suited connectors, suited aces
3. **Position:** More 3-bets in position, tighter out of position

**3-Bet Sizing:**
- In Position: 3x their raise
- Out of Position: 3.5-4x their raise
- Vs limpers: 3bb + 1bb per limper

### 4-Betting (Re-Re-Raising)
**Value 4-Bets:** AA, KK (sometimes QQ, AK if opponent is aggressive)
**Bluff 4-Bets:** Occasional AQ, AJs vs aggressive 3-bettors
**Sizing:** ~2.5x their 3-bet

### Calling 3-Bets
**Call with:**
- Medium pairs (JJ-66) to set mine
- Suited connectors/suited aces with deep stacks
- Premium hands for deception (slowplay AA/KK occasionally)

### Squeezing
**When:** Someone opens, another calls, you're in position with a strong hand
**Hands:** AQ+, TT+, occasionally suited Broadway
**Sizing:** 4-5x initial raise

---

## Post-Flop Play

### C-Betting (Continuation Betting)

**When to C-Bet:**
1. **You have equity** (pair, draw, overcards)
2. **Board favors your range** (you opened UTG, flop comes K-Q-7)
3. **Heads-up pots** (more profitable than multiway)
4. **In position** (more fold equity)

**When to CHECK:**
1. **Board favors opponent** (you opened, flop comes low connected cards vs BB)
2. **Multiway pots** (someone likely has something)
3. **Out of position with marginal hands** (pot control)

**C-Bet Sizing:**
- **Small (25-40% pot):** Weak hands, continuation, protection
- **Medium (50-70% pot):** Standard value, balanced range
- **Large (75-100%+ pot):** Polarized (nuts or air), protection vs draws

### Flop Texture Analysis

**Dry Boards (K-7-2 rainbow, A-8-3 two-tone):**
- Favor pre-flop aggressor
- High c-bet frequency
- Opponent has less equity/draws

**Wet Boards (9-8-7 two-tone, Q-J-T, 6-7-8 suited):**
- Favor calling range (more connected hands)
- Lower c-bet frequency
- Be careful with one-pair hands

**Monotone Boards (All same suit):**
- Extremely coordinated
- Proceed with caution
- Strong hands often get paid (set, straight + flush draw)

### Turn Play

**Double Barrel Bluffing:**
- Continue story from flop c-bet
- Pick cards that improve your perceived range
- Size: 60-75% pot

**Turn Value Betting:**
- Top pair + good kicker or better
- Size: 50-70% pot
- Go bigger with vulnerable hands (overpair on draw-heavy board)

**Turn Pot Control:**
- Check back medium strength (2nd pair, weak top pair)
- Keeps pot manageable
- Re-evaluate on river

### River Play

**Value Betting:**
- Bet for value with hands that beat 50%+ of opponent's calling range
- Size: 50-100% pot depending on nut advantage
- Don't bet scared - get value from weaker hands

**River Bluffing:**
- Story must make sense (consistent with flop/turn action)
- Target specific folds (did they draw and miss?)
- Size: 60-100% pot (big enough to fold out marginal hands)

**River Call/Fold Decision:**
- Use pot odds (getting 3:1? Need to be good 25% of the time)
- Consider opponent's range (what bluffs/value makes sense?)
- Live tells vs online history

---

## Pot Odds & Expected Value

### Pot Odds Calculation
**Formula:** Pot Odds = Amount to Call / (Pot + Amount to Call)

**Example:**
- Pot = $100
- Opponent bets $50
- You need to call $50
- Pot Odds = 50 / (100 + 50 + 50) = 50/200 = 25% = 4:1

**You need to win 25% of the time to break even.**

### Equity Calculation

**Outs = Cards that improve your hand**

**Common Draw Outs:**
- **Flush Draw:** 9 outs (13 suited cards - 4 you've seen)
- **Open-Ended Straight Draw:** 8 outs
- **Gutshot Straight Draw:** 4 outs
- **Overcards (2):** 6 outs

**Rule of 2 and 4:**
- **Flop to River:** Multiply outs x 4 = approximate %
  - 9 outs (flush) x 4 = ~36%
- **Turn to River:** Multiply outs x 2 = approximate %
  - 9 outs x 2 = ~18%

### Expected Value (EV)

**Formula:** EV = (% Win x Pot) - (% Lose x Call Amount)

**Example:**
- Pot = $100
- Call = $50
- You have flush draw = 36% equity

EV = (0.36 x $150) - (0.64 x $50)
EV = $54 - $32 = +$22

**Positive EV = CALL**

### Implied Odds
**Beyond immediate pot odds:**
- How much can you win on later streets if you hit?
- Small pairs vs raises: Direct odds are bad, but if you flop a set you can win a huge pot

**Example:**
- Effective stacks: $500
- Pre-flop: Opponent raises $20, you have 44
- Pot odds = bad
- **But:** If you hit a set, you might win $200+ more
- Implied odds = GOOD, therefore call

## GTO vs Exploitative Play

### GTO (Game Theory Optimal)
**What:** Unexploitable strategy, mathematically balanced
**How:** Mix of value bets and bluffs at optimal frequencies
**Pros:** Can't be exploited, profitable vs unknowns
**Cons:** May not maximize profit vs weak players

**GTO Bluffing Frequency:**
Formula: Bluff Frequency = (Bet Size) / (Bet Size + Pot)

- Bet 50% pot → Bluff 33% of the time
- Bet 75% pot → Bluff 43% of the time  
- Bet pot-sized → Bluff 50% of the time

### Exploitative Play
**What:** Adjust strategy to exploit opponent's specific leaks
**How:** Identify tendencies, deviate from GTO to maximize profit

**Exploit Tight Players (Nits):**
- Bluff more frequently
- Fold when they show aggression
- Steal their blinds relentlessly

**Exploit Loose Players (Fish):**
- Value bet thinner (they call too wide)
- Bluff less (they don't fold enough)
- Isolate them in position

**Exploit Calling Stations:**
- Never bluff
- Only bet for value
- Thin value bets with medium-strength hands

**Exploit Maniacs:**
- Call down lighter
- Let them bluff off stack
- Trap with strong hands (check/call, check/raise)

---

## Bet Sizing

### Pre-Flop Sizing
- **Open Raise:** 2.5-3bb
- **3-Bet:** 3-4x their raise
- **4-Bet:** 2.5x their 3-bet
- **All-In:** When stack < 15bb

### Post-Flop Sizing

**Small (25-40% pot):**
- Weak hands continuing story
- Protection bets
- Inducing bluff-raises from opponents

**Medium (50-70% pot):**
- Standard value bets
- Balanced c-betting
- Most common size

**Large (75-150% pot):**
- Polarized range (nuts or bluffs)
- Protection vs draws
- Overbet when you have range/nut advantage

**All-In:**
- Short stack (< 1 pot-sized bet left)
- All-in or fold situations
- River value shoves with the nuts

---

## Range Construction

### Opening Ranges by Position

**UTG (15%):**
AA-TT, AKs-AQs, AKo

**MP (20%):**
UTG + 99-77, AJs, KQs

**CO (30%):**
MP + 66-22, ATs, A9s-A2s, KJs-KTs, QJs-QTs, JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s, 76s

**BTN (50%):**
CO + All suited aces, suited connectors, suited one-gappers, most Broadway

### 3-Bet Ranges

**Value (Polarized):**
AA-QQ, AK

**Bluff (Polarized):**
A5s-A2s (blocker to AA/AK), suited connectors

**Linear (vs weaker opponents):**
Add JJ, AQ, AJs, KQs

### Calling Ranges

**Flop Call vs C-Bet:**
- Draws (flush draw, straight draw, combo draws)
- Weak made hands (bottom pair, gutshot + pair)
- Marginal strength (middle pair, weak top pair)

**Turn Call vs Double Barrel:**
- Strong draws (flush draw + overcards)
- Medium-strength hands (top pair decent kicker)
- Bluff-catchers (when opponent is bluffy)

**River Call vs Shove:**
- Bluff-catchers (if getting right price and opponent over-bluffs)
- Medium-strength hands if story doesn't make sense
- Strong hands for trap (check/call with sets, straights)

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Facing a Pre-Flop Raise
**Situation:** UTG raises, you're in the CO with QJs

**Solution:**
- **Vs Tight Player:** Call (has strong range, we're in position)
- **Vs Loose Player:** 3-bet (he's raising wide, we have good equity)
- **Vs Unknown:** Call (safest option, speculative hand)

### Scenario 2: You C-Bet, Get Raised
**Situation:** You raise BTN with AK, BB calls. Flop K-7-2r, you c-bet 50% pot, BB raises 3x

**Solution:**
- **Vs Tight Player:** Call (he has sets/two-pair, re-evaluate turn)
- **Vs Aggressive Player:** 3-bet or call (he can have draws, weaker kings)
- **Your Action:** Usually call, sometimes 3-bet if opponent is capable of bluffing

### Scenario 3: Missed C-Bet Spot
**Situation:** You raise UTG with AK, flop comes 9-8-7 rainbow, 3 callers

**Solution:**
- **Check:** Board favors calling ranges, multiway pot, you have 0 equity
- **If Checked Through:** Barrel turn if A or K comes
- **If Bet Into:** Fold unless getting amazing price with backdoor draws

### Scenario 4: Set on Wet Board
**Situation:** You call CO raise with 77 in BB, flop comes Q-7-6 two-tone

**Solution:**
- **Check/Raise:** Protect vs draws, build pot
- **Lead Out:** 50-70% pot, rep top pair
- **Trap:** Check/call flop, check/raise turn (if turn isn't a scare card)

### Scenario 5: Flush Draw on Flop
**Situation:** You call BTN open in BB with A♠5♠, flop comes K♠9♠3♣

**Solution:**
- **Vs C-Bet:** Check pot odds + implied odds
  - Getting 3:1 or better → Call
  - Big stacks, aggressive opponent → Call (implied odds)
- **Vs Check:** Bet 40% pot (semi-bluff)

### Scenario 6: River Decision - Bluff Catcher
**Situation:** You have A♥Q♥ on K♥Q♣4♠8♠2♣, opponent barrels all three streets, shoves river for pot

**Solution:**
Calculate:
- **Pot Odds:** Getting 2:1 (need to be good 33%)
- **Opponent's Range:** Strong hands (sets, straights unlikely), missed draws (flush draw, straight draw), some top pairs
- **Decision:** If opponent is balanced, this is close call/fold. If opponent over-bluffs, call. If opponent is nitty, fold.

## Advanced Concepts

### Range Merging
**Concept:** Bet same size with strong and medium hands (vs just strong or weak)
**Why:** Makes you less exploitable, harder to put on hand
**Example:** Flop top pair, bet 60% pot. Turn improves to two-pair, bet 60% again (not pot-sized)

### Blockers
**Concept:** Holding a card reduces combinations opponent can have
**Example:** You have A♠K♠ and bluff river. Opponent less likely to have AA, KK, AK (you block them)

### Polarization vs Linear
**Polarized Range:** Nuts or air (no medium strength)
- Use when betting big/shoving
- River bluffs

**Linear Range:** Top-down value (best to decent hands)
- Use when betting smaller
- Value betting flop/turn

### Multi-Street Planning
**Think ahead:**
- If I c-bet flop and get called, what turn cards let me double barrel?
- If I check back flop, what river cards let me value bet?
- What's my plan if I get check/raised on turn?

### ICM (Tournament Considerations)
**Independent Chip Model:** Chip value changes based on tournament stage
- **Early:** Chips = linear value
- **Bubble:** Survival matters, avoid marginal spots
- **Final Table:** Ladder positions, adjust vs short stacks
