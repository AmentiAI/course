# FORGE — Crypto Creator CRM
## The Operating System for Web3 Communities

---

## The Problem
Crypto creators, NFT collections, and Web3 projects manage their communities
across 6+ platforms with zero connective tissue:

- Twitter/X DMs scattered everywhere
- Discord server with no CRM data
- Telegram group, no insights
- Holders tracked in a Google Sheet
- Collab opportunities lost in DMs
- No idea who their top 100 community members are
- Royalties + revenue tracked manually
- Whitelists managed in Excel
- Can't connect a wallet address to a Twitter handle

**Result:** Projects lose community, miss revenue, and burn out on manual work.

## The Solution: Forge

One platform that:
1. **Knows who every community member is** — wallet, Twitter, Discord, all linked
2. **Tracks every interaction** — tweets, Discord messages, onchain activity
3. **Manages collabs like a sales pipeline** — never miss an opportunity
4. **Runs campaigns** — DMs, announcements, airdrops, WL management
5. **Shows your revenue** — royalties, primary sales, mint revenue in one view
6. **Alerts you to what matters** — whale buys, viral mentions, key holder activity

## Core Modules

### 1. 🧠 CONTACTS — Community Intelligence
- Unified profile per community member (wallet + Twitter + Discord + Telegram)

- Holder status (do they hold your NFT?)
- Tags & segments (whale, OG, artist, KOL, etc.)
- Notes & activity history
- Last contact date
- Wallet balance & portfolio snapshot

### 2. 📊 ANALYTICS — Multi-Platform Intelligence
- Twitter: followers, engagement, mentions, sentiment, best time to post
- Discord: member growth, channel activity, top members
- Telegram: member count, message activity
- Farcaster: casts, engagement (future)
- Cross-platform community overlap analysis

### 3. 💰 REVENUE — Money Dashboard

## Competitive Moat
1. **Wallet-native identity** — link wallet to social (nobody does this well)
2. **Ordinals-native** — built for Bitcoin NFTs, underserved market
3. **All-in-one** — vs 5+ separate tools
4. **Automation** — set and forget community management
5. **Collab pipeline** — no crypto-native deal flow tool exists
