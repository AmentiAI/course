## Moat Builder: Unique Data Assets

As users connect their Twitter, Discord, and holder data:
- **Network effects:** More projects = better cross-collection holder overlap insights
- **Data moat:** Aggregated community behavior data nobody else has
- **Switching costs:** All contact history, automations, and pipeline data locked in
- **Proprietary scores:** Engagement score, holder score, whale score based on our data

**Forge becomes irreplaceable within 90 days of use.** That's the goal.
